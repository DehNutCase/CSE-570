Printing kernels of the canonical states of the grammar:

Format of a state is: [{dictionary of non_terminals: dictionary of productions}, symbol}]
i.e. a state of the form [{'S': {'.A': true}}, '('] has the production S -> .A, and is reached
by calling goto(I, '(')
Note that the added state "S'" isn't produced by goto, hence it doesn't have a symbol

State # 0  is
[{"S'": {".S": true}}, "S'"]
State # 1  is
[{"E": {"(.FL)": true}}, "("]
State # 2  is
[{"S'": {"S.": true}}, "S"]
State # 3  is
[{"S": {"E.": true}}, "E"]
State # 4  is
[{"F": {"*.": true}}, "*"]
State # 5  is
[{"F": {"d.": true}}, "d"]
State # 6  is
[{"F": {"+.": true}}, "+"]
State # 7  is
[{"E": {"(F.L)": true}}, "F"]
State # 8  is
[{"F": {"-.": true}}, "-"]
State # 9  is
[{"I": {"n.": true}}, "n"]
State # 10  is
[{"L": {"I.": true}}, "I"]
State # 11  is
[{"L": {"L.I": true}, "E": {"(FL.)": true}}, "L"]
State # 12  is
[{"I": {"E.": true}}, "E"]
State # 13  is
[{"L": {"LI.": true}}, "I"]
State # 14  is
[{"E": {"(FL).": true}}, ")"]

Printing the canonical states of the grammar:
Obtained by calling closure(I) on the kernel of a state
State # 0  is
Obtained by goto(I,  S' )
{"S'": {'.S': True}, 'S': {'.E': True}, 'E': {'.(FL)': True}}
State # 1  is
Obtained by goto(I,  ( )
{'F': {'.+': True, '.d': True, '.*': True, '.-': True}, 'E': {'(.FL)': True}}
State # 2  is
Obtained by goto(I,  S )
{"S'": {'S.': True}}
State # 3  is
Obtained by goto(I,  E )
{'S': {'E.': True}}
State # 4  is
Obtained by goto(I,  * )
{'F': {'*.': True}}
State # 5  is
Obtained by goto(I,  d )
{'F': {'d.': True}}
State # 6  is
Obtained by goto(I,  + )
{'F': {'+.': True}}
State # 7  is
Obtained by goto(I,  F )
{'L': {'.LI': True, '.I': True}, 'I': {'.E': True, '.n': True}, 'E': {'.(FL)': True, '(F.L)': True}}
State # 8  is
Obtained by goto(I,  - )
{'F': {'-.': True}}
State # 9  is
Obtained by goto(I,  n )
{'I': {'n.': True}}
State # 10  is
Obtained by goto(I,  I )
{'L': {'I.': True}}
State # 11  is
Obtained by goto(I,  L )
{'L': {'L.I': True}, 'I': {'.E': True, '.n': True}, 'E': {'.(FL)': True, '(FL.)': True}}
State # 12  is
Obtained by goto(I,  E )
{'I': {'E.': True}}
State # 13  is
Obtained by goto(I,  I )
{'L': {'LI.': True}}
State # 14  is
Obtained by goto(I,  ) )
{'E': {'(FL).': True}}
